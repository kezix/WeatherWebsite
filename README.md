# **Weather website with own API** ☀️
This website supports only a few countries because it uses its own API, to which data is sent by volunteers who support the site.


## **Getting started**

Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```
  Start the server:
```console
$ npm run dev
```


## **To build that project I used:**
